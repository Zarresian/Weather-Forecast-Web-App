# Weather-Forecast-Web-App

● Created a Weather Data API to show the weather, temperature, across stations around Europe
for a particular date which the users can access and view the JSON data as a dictionary.

● Flask web framework used to create multiple web-pages.

● Analyzed the weather data with Jupyter and Pandas; the data set has 200 years worth of
weather information, extracted (filtered) only the relevant data needed.

● Thanks to the points given above, the creation of the app was born; the app visualizes the
temperature, or the sky condition, of any place in the world in a graph across multiple days.
